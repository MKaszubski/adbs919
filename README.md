A sketch that imports financial data from an external .csv file which allows prices of US (Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100 , S&P 500) and UK (FTSE 100) stock indexes to be compared
with new daily coronavirus cases ine the US and UK to potentially seek out an opportunity to make money on the financial markets by indicating when covid cases 
are higher, price of indexes turns to be more volatile if compared to a pre-coronavirus market.
This is not financial advice, simply just an indicator.
